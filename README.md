# politicalDonors
project to trace online source and conversations 

The asignment:

You need to visit this website: http://www.opensecrets.org Your paper needs to investigate and analyze two things: First, report on something interesting that you found when looking at DONORS of campaign money. You can find a lot of information on this under the "Lobbying & Groups" page in the menu at the top of the page. Second, report on something interesting ABOUT ONE OF YOUR ELECTED MEMBERS OF CONGRESS that you found when looking at RECIPIENTS of campaign money.  You can find a lot of information on this under the "Politicians" page in the menu at the top of the page. After you have done this, provide an educated opinion about money in American politics based upon the information you found on this website. Your 900-word paper needs to be submitted by midnight, Sunday, November 16th. 

What I am actually going to do is hightlight what I already know about how political finance works. In prior years I have alreay interanced with opensecretes though their API as well as other sources. So I have been following the money for years and am not suprised by anything funding wise..
