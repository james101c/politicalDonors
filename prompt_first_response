Short version:


Yes, there are internationally funded programs that give cash or debit-card assistance to migrants in Latin America, including many who intend to travel toward the U.S.


The money is officially framed as “humanitarian cash assistance” (for rent, food, medicine, etc.), not “here’s cash to go illegally to the U.S.” – but critics argue that in practice it can help people keep moving north.


Most of this is run by UN agencies + NGO partners, funded by the U.S., EU, and other governments.


I’ll break it into two buckets:

1. Before people reach the U.S. (en route through Latin America)
Main organizations involved in cash assistance
These are the entities you see over and over in UN and donor documents for Latin America:
UN agencies (not technically NGOs, but usually lumped into the same discussion):


UNHCR (UN Refugee Agency) – runs “cash-based interventions” for refugees and asylum seekers; in southern Mexico (Tapachula), they have issued debit cards and cash for vulnerable people seeking asylum in Mexico. A UNHCR spokesperson told the Center for Immigration Studies that this cash is short-term, targeted aid to people intending to remain in the Mexican state where they filed for asylum, to cover basic living expenses while their Mexican asylum claims are processed. CIS.org


IOM (International Organization for Migration) – runs “cash-based interventions” and “cash-based transfers” worldwide for people on the move, including Latin America, often via debit cards, vouchers or bank/mobile transfers. International Organization for Migration+1


UNICEF – participates in cash-based interventions for families and children on the move in Latin America, often in coordination platforms for Venezuelan and other migrants. UNICEF+1


WFP (World Food Programme) – uses cash and voucher assistance (CVA) as a key tool for food security; in Latin America it works alongside UNHCR, IOM, Caritas and others in these same migrant response plans. r4v.info+1


NGO networks under the R4V / RMRP umbrella
For refugees and migrants (especially from Venezuela), much of the regional response is coordinated through the Regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan (RMRP) / R4V platform. This brings together hundreds of partners – UN agencies plus NGOs – and explicitly prioritizes cash and voucher assistance as a modality. r4v.info+1
Examples of NGOs in this network that work with cash or voucher assistance in Latin America:


Caritas (various branches: Caritas Brazil, Caritas Peru, Caritas Bolivia, Caritas Switzerland, diocesan Caritas, etc.) – repeatedly listed as R4V partners for Venezuelan migrants, including in Southern Cone situation reports and partner lists. RMRP+1


Action Against Hunger – named as a top partner in the Food Security / cash assistance response for migrants in the region. accioncontraelhambrelatinoamerica.org


ADRA (Adventist Development and Relief Agency) – also listed among the top regional partners delivering direct assistance, including cash/food security actions. RMRP+1


HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) – appears as one of the major partners in the R4V food-security/cash response for migrants. accioncontraelhambrelatinoamerica.org


Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) – cited in food-security sector docs as one of the organizations involved in assistance, alongside WFP, IOM, Caritas and UNHCR. accioncontraelhambrelatinoamerica.org


CARE, Danish Refugee Council (DRC), various local CSOs and faith-based groups – show up in the RMRP 2025-26 partner list and country sitreps, some of which involve cash-based or voucher assistance. RMRP+1


These groups are not all doing the same thing; some run shelters, some do legal aid, some handle food, etc., but cash/voucher programs are clearly part of the toolkit in the official planning documents. r4v.info+1
How government money gets into these programs


The U.S. State Department (Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration) and USAID provide humanitarian funding to “international organizations and NGOs” in Mexico and Central America, explicitly including cash-based programs. One State Dept release from 2022 notes nearly $200 million in humanitarian assistance for Mexico and Central America, channeled through international organizations and NGOs. State Department+1


The RMRP / R4V documents list key donors such as the EU, Canada, Japan, Korea, Sweden, Spain, etc., all funding sectors that emphasize cash and voucher assistance for refugees and migrants. RMRP+1


So: government money (including U.S. money) → UN agencies → NGO networks → cash/voucher assistance to migrants, some of whom are indeed “in-transit” toward the United States.
Where the “cash to travel to the US” language comes from
Critics, especially at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) and some members of Congress, argue that these humanitarian cash programs function in practice as “travel subsidies”:


CIS reporting in 2022 described UNHCR debit cards in Tapachula, Mexico and cited UN documents saying cash can be used for lodging and even transportation costs, and that the UN planned to ramp up “cash-based interventions” across the migrant trail from Panama to the U.S. border. CIS.org


Later CIS analysis of UN budget documents claimed that UN agencies and partners planned to spend about $372 million in “Cash and Voucher Assistance / Multipurpose Cash Assistance” to roughly 624,000 migrants “in transit to the United States” in 2024, via prepaid debit cards, “cash in envelopes,” bank transfers, etc. CIS.org+1


In a 2025 House Oversight hearing, CIS director Mark Krikorian testified that U.S.-funded UN agencies and NGOs provided “cash-based interventions” (debit cards, envelopes of cash) and transportation facilitation along Latin American routes, and argued this encouraged illegal immigration. Oversight Committee+1


The UN agencies themselves frame it differently: they say this is short-term support for basic needs (food, rent, medicine) for people who are seeking asylum or are in vulnerable conditions, not a program whose official aim is “paying for their trip to the U.S.” CIS.org+1

2. After people arrive in the U.S. (resettlement cash)
Separate from “in-transit” aid, there’s also government-funded cash assistance once people are already in the U.S. with legal status (refugees, certain parolees, etc.):


The U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement (HHS/ORR) funds NGOs for refugee resettlement. These include well-known groups like International Rescue Committee (IRC), Church World Service, HIAS, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, and others. They administer short-term cash and rent support, Matching Grant employment programs, and similar assistance so people can get on their feet after arrival. USCRI+1


That’s cash in the U.S., but not “cash to travel here”; it’s post-arrival support for people admitted under U.S. law.

3. A few important caveats


No official program literally says “here’s money so you can illegally cross into the U.S.”


The official language is humanitarian aid and protection for refugees/migrants, with cash as one modality.


However, because cash is flexible, recipients can decide how to use it, and critics argue that inevitably includes paying for their onward journey north.




A lot of viral claims exaggerate or distort this.


Fact-checkers have debunked specific social-media claims like “Biden signed an order to give every illegal immigrant a $5,000 gift card” or “every migrant gets a $3,500 debit card from the U.S. government” – those claims are false or wildly inaccurate even though some migrants do receive humanitarian cash from programs that receive U.S. funding. PolitiFact+2Fact Check AFP+2




The ecosystem is big and constantly changing.


There isn’t a single static list of “NGOs that pay migrants to go to the U.S.”


Instead, you have large, rotating consortia (R4V/RMRP and others) with hundreds of partners that may at times implement cash-assistance projects along common migration routes.





If you want, I can next:


Pull out 5–10 specific NGO names and summarize exactly what kind of cash/voucher programs each one runs in Latin America, or


Help you frame this in a paper or op-ed, e.g., distinguishing between humanitarian intent vs. real-world effect on migration flows.
